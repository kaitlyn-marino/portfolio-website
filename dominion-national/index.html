            <p>The project goal was to create a more user friendly website and implement responsive design. Specific features were flagged for updating as they were not functional in the live environment. For example, the navigation menu was disappearing and the user was unable to navigate to any of those pages. The design did not utilize the full width of the page and when resized to fit mobile or tablet, the text and design elements were not wrapping correctly, therefore getting cut off.</p>
            <p>All content remained the same and was only modified in the event of a user experience design change. Branding rules and style guides were followed to complete the design process.</p>
            <p>I designed mock-ups of the new webpages and layouts, created working prototypes of the mobile friendly version to use as the base for coding, coded the HTML and stylized the CSS, and added fluid responsive design.</p>
            <p>Please note only a handful of pages were updated at this time. Please refer to the following pages: Home, Dental, Vision, Find a Dentist, Find a Vision Provider, Members, Dentists, and Groups. </p>

By adding buttons the user functions available on the page become more clear and allow the useer to continue moving through the website easier and quicker. Buttons were stylized with hover commands on the desktop version so the user can quickly identify when they are positioned over the button. Telephone references were added to phone numbers for call links to populate.</p>
