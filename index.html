                    <h2>A litte bit about me.</h2>
                    <div class="half-width">
                        <p>My journey started in the city as a graphic designer for three years. 
                            Life takes you by surprise and I ended up moving 
                            to a small town in North Carolina where life is more simple. 
                            Getting out of the city opened my eyes and helped me find my passion, web development. 
                            </p>

                        <p>You see, when I was a graphic designer I was thrown into the web and was learning as I went.
                            I was intrigued by the way web pages were built and loved the thrill of mastering a challenging code.
                            Here I am today, designing websites using clean code and responsive design.
